## Completing the module

1. Create a new branch in your 'php-final' git repo called `architecture` and commit all the work from this module there.
2. Following the Laravel conventions and patterns for database architectures, create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using Crow's Foot Notation to diagram the Entities and Relationships below.
3. Use whatever attributes you think are necessary for each Entity. Be sure to include necessary "timestamp" attributes for each Entity to conform to the Laravel standard.
4. Use whatever diagramming tool you like. You could even draw it and take a picture if you like, as long as the diagram is clear.
