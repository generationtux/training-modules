# Module 5: PHP Coding Standards

***

## Getting Started

Prior to completing the module below you'll need to review the [Generation Tux Development Standards](development-standards.md).

***

## Completing the Module

Create a new branch in your `php-final` git repo called `psr-2` and refactor your PHP code to conform to the PSR-2 standard. Be sure to write all your future PHP code to conform to PSR-2.

***

## Wrapping Up

When you are done, push your code to GitHub. Please create a tag called `v1.3` with a message of `"ready for review"`. Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitHub.

Create an issue titled **Review Module 5 - PHP Coding Standards** and assign it to [**@generationtux-helmsmen**](https://github.com/generationtux-helmsmen).
