# Module 5: PHP Documentation Standards

***

## Getting Started

Prior to completing the module below it is highly recommended that you look at the following learning material:

**Note:** PHPDocumentor2's 2.0 release documentation standard is the standard that new PHP development will conform to at Generation Tux.

- [PHPDoc Documentation Standards](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2/blob/v2.0.0/docs/PSR.md)

***

## The Test

Create a new branch in your `php-final` git repo called `documentation` and commit all the work from this module there. Again, be sure to write any code to **conform to the `PSR-2` standard**.

Add documentation to your code that conforms to the documentation spec above.

***

## Wrapping Up

When you are done, push your code to GitHub. Please create a tag called `v1.5` with a message of `"ready for review"`. Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitHub.

Create an issue titled **Review Module 5 - PHP Documentation Standards** and `@mention` your mentor and team leader.
