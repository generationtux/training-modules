# Answers to Subnets and Route Tables

What is the difference between a private and a public subnet in aws cloud 
services?

If a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gateway then the subnet is 
known as a public subnet.

What is a vpn only subnet?

If a subnet doesn't have a route to the Internet gateway, but has its
traffic routed to a virtual private gateway for a VPN connection, the subnet
is known as a VPN-only subnet. In this diagram, subnet 3 is a VPN-only
subnet. Currently, we do not support IPv6 traffic over a VPN connection.
