# Module 6: Advanced TDD: Codeception

***

## Getting Started

Prior to completing the module below it is highly recommended that you look at the following learning material:

- [How to Write Testable and Maintainable Code in PHP](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/how-to-write-testable-and-maintainable-code-in-php/)
- [Modern Testing In PHP With Codeception](https://tutsplus.com/course/modern-testing-in-php-with-codeception/)
- [Codeception Documentation](http://codeception.com/docs/01-Introduction)

_Before you can run Codeception on your Mac, you'll need to add a `date.timezone` configuration to your `/etc/php.ini.default` and rename it to `php.ini`._

***

## The Test

Create a new branch in your 'php-final' Git repo called `codeception` and commit all the work from this module there. Be sure to write any code to conform to the PSR-2 standard.

1. Install Codeception using Composer
2. Using Codeception and your basic MVC application create at least 1 of each of the following tests:
    - Unit Test
	  - Acceptance Test using the PhpBrowser back-end
3. Stage, commit and push your code to GitHub.
4. Refactor your acceptance test settings to use Codeception's WebDriver as the back-end.

## Wrapping Up

When you are done, push your code to GitHub. Please create a tag called `v1.6` with a message of `"ready for review"`.  Be sure your tags are pushed to the remote repository and are visible in GitHub.

Create an issue titled **Review Module 6 - Advanced TDD: Codeception** and `@mention` your mentor and team leader.
